# Info-About-FNF-YML-Builds
Look at the README

So I found an idea from kade engine where you see the action builds so i decided to copy the code and paste it into other fnf engines or mods but when the build is complete i decided to take a test by running it as if it runs it crashed when its near the title screen idk what error code is it but i dont have my own computer so i have to use the schools
